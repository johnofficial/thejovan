UX sitemap is a hierarchical diagram of linked pages. 
It will show us a full picture of our website so we can make better design decisions.
Allow us to prioritize pages and plan for usability. This will allow us to trim unnecessary pages and keep what's important. A sitemap helps us see if pages are properly linked, and we will strategically place content where users will easily find it. Also, we can see if the page labels are understandable to users.
