Do you want to use real-life data and dynamically show elements in your prototype without creating artboards for every possible combination? 

It seems there is a way to create prototypes that are so good, no one will assume it's not production-ready! 

I got bored by telling friends while early testing 'Oh, that part is not yet designed, check this one...'! I want more realistic prototypes without creating endless combinations!

And I discovered the new shiny thing, and this one is not interesting just because it's new, this seems usable too!
