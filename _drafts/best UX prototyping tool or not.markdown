Do you want to use real-life data and dynamically show elements in your prototype without creating artboards for every possible combination? 

It seems there is a way to create prototypes that are so good, no one will assume it's not production-ready!

I got bored by telling friends while early testing 'Oh, that part is not yet designed, check this one...'! I want more realistic prototypes without creating endless combinations!

And I discovered the new shiny thing, and this one is not interesting just because it's new, this seems usable too!

This Intro won't tell you much about it but feel free to take a look.
