Do you want to use real-life data and dynamically show elements in your prototype without creating artboards for every possible combination?

It seems there is a way to create prototypes that are so good, no one will assume it's not production-ready!

I got bored by telling friends while early testing 'Oh, that part is not yet designed, check this one...'! I want more realistic prototypes without creating endless combinations!

And I discovered the new shiny thing, and this one is not interesting just because it's new, this seems usable too!

## This Intro won't tell you much about it but feel free to take a look.

## What's the deal about it?

You can use video, maps, login, scroll horizontally/vertically, and more!

The good thing for code loving designers is that you can create code components and use React for prototyping! More about Framer & React at <a href="https://www.framer.com/books/framer-guide-to-react/" target="_blank">FRAMER GUIDE TO REACT</a>.

Framer seems like a great tool, I didn't fully switch from Adobe XD, but as I need to create more realistic prototypes I will transition to Framer.

I wish you luck and keep hacking!
