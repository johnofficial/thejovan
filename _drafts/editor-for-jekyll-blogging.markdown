## I'm a fan of Jekyll from the early start of my career! I'm using it for every portfolio website I created (except one), and I'm using Jekyll for client-related work as much as possible!

Since not that long time ago I wanted to publish posts on my blog, but it can be so 'painful' for lazy people like me to open editor, create and write markdown, use all naming convention, add thumbnail into assets, push commits, etc...

Lucky for lazy people like me, I found [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/), and I just needed to connect it with my public GitHub repo, and everything is set!
