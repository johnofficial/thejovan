Some time ago, I needed a time tracking app for some of my projects. The good thing is that there is a lot of time tracking apps!
But, of course, If I were satisfied with some of them, I wouldn't make this post :D 

I wanted a really simple app, just to track my projects and if it's possible to somehow remind me when to start and stop. Oh, and if there is an app to just stop tracking automatically when I stop working. 

After using Toggle for some time, I decided to try designing an app that will suit my needs. 

The design was nice, I thought, and I even knew Front-End, but I didn't want another web time tracker. I didn't want another tab or window open, I wanted something simple and easy to use.

## So I decided to quit

But this year, I started experimenting with something called Electron.js, and it was mind-blowing. I couldn't believe I can write HTML, CSS, JS, and create an app for macOS, Windows, and Linux, and all that with just one codebase. IT WAS AMAZING!

<br>

## So I started working on it again

I found Angular-Electron starter kit on GitHub, and slowly started with slicing design screen by screen. 


It was an amazing experience. There were so many things that were harder than I expected to be, and there were so many easy to do things that I expected to be hard. 

I finally published 1.0.0 version :D 


I published a post on [Product Hunt], and if you are curious about it, you can visit [The Track Website].

#### Feel free to leave harsh feedback.

I'm planning to launch more products and getting real feedback will prevent me from making the same mistakes again.
